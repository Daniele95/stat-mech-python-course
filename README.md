# Introduction to Statistical Mechanics in Python 3
Introduction to Statistical Mechanics in python 3.x, using jupyter notebooks.
This repository is part of the University of Milano course *Introduzione alla Fisica Statistica*. 


## How to follow these lectures
We will go through the notebooks in the `session-*` folders together. Each notebook explores a different topic and proposes some **exercises for you to do**. There will be some time for you to try the exercises, and we will solve some of them together.

Please send your solutions **no later than two weeks** after the lecture to *francesc.font@unimi.it*. Also, please rename the `.ipynb` file and add your name to it: 1.1-Generating-Random-Numbers-**Mario-Rossi**.ipynb


## Starting the jupyter app
Open a terminal and `cd` to a directory of your choice
```bash
$ cd Documents
```
If you are using a desktop computer at *Laboratorio Calcolo*, you need to activate the anaconda python installation
```bash
$ module load python3/anaconda
```
If you are using your laptop, check that you have correctly installed Anaconda's python. 
```bash
$ which python
/home/username/anaconda3/bin/python
```
Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fontclos/stat-mech-python-course.git
```
A new folder called `stat-mech-python-course` will be created. Enter it and start jupyter by typing `jupyter lab`
```bash
cd stat-mech-python-course
jupyter lab
```
A browser window/tab pointing to `localhost:8888` will open automatically. Open the `session-1-intro-probability` folder, then open the first notebook by double-clicking `1.1-Generating-Random-Numbers.ipynb`. You are ready to go!


## Installing jupyter in your computer
If you want to try this at home, you need a modern installation of `python`, together with `jupyter`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and some other standard python libraries. The simplest way to install all this without interfeering with your current python installation is the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Choose **python 3.x** and your OS, download, install, and you should be good to go.
