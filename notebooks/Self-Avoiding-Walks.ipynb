    "# Self-Avoiding Walks\n",
    "Self-avoiding walks (SAW) are simply random walks in a regular lattice with the additional constraint that no point can be visited more than once. That is, SAW cannot intersect themselves. The most well-known application of SAW is to model linear polymers, where obviously two monomers cannot occupy the same space (excluded volume effect).\n",

    "## Simulating Self-Avoiding Walks\n",
    "Generating a SAW is not trivial. If you try to generate a SAW stochastically, that is, one step at a time, you will miserably fail: your walker might get into traps (configurations with no allowed movements), and if it does you will have to discard your simulation. It turns out you will have to discard your simulation *really* often, so that for large lengths, you will basically never find a valid path. In addition, the paths you will find for short lengths will not come up with the right probabilities. Bear in mind that we want to **uniformly sample** the set of SAW of given length $n$, SAW($n$). That is, we want that all paths from SAW($n$) are generated with the same probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use a Monte Carlo algorithm that, given one element $\\alpha \\in \\text{SAW}(n)$, generates a new one $\\beta \\in \\text{SAW}(n)$ with some probability $P_{\\alpha \\beta}$. If in addition our algorithm satisfies **detailed balance** and is **ergodic**, then we known that it will converge to the equilibrium distribution (the uniform distribution in our case).\n"

    "(tip: if you're at home, **do not** use tools such as sci-hub to download the paper).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a self-avoiding walk of length $n$, the pivot algorithm generates the next walk $\\beta \\in \\text{SAW}(n)$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a point of $\\alpha$ at random**, splitting the path in two bits: the head (from the origin to the chosen point) and the tail (from the chosen point to the end of the path). Notice that both the head and the tail are SAWs.\n",
    "2. **Apply a transformation to the tail**, leaving the head intact. The transformation must be an orthoganl transformation that leaves the regular lattice intact (so, either a reflection or a $90º, 180º$ or $270º$ rotation). For simplicity, we will use only **rotations** (read the paper to see why this is ok).\n",
    "3. **Check if the new path is self-avoiding**. If so, return it. Otherwise, return the original path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating these steps one obtains a **Markov** chain of SAWs: $\\alpha_1 \\to \\alpha_2 \\to \\dots \\to \\alpha_M $. Notice that $\\alpha_i$ are not uncorrelated, but because the algorithm satisfies detailed balance and is ergodic, we know that it approaches the equilibrium distribution. This means that we can use our Markov chain to compute **expected values** as long as it is long enough."
